 Image Analysis in ASP.NET Core 5.0 using Azure Cognitive Service <br>
Azure’s computer vision services give wide range of options to do image analysis. These AI services enable to discover the content and analyze images and videos in real time. Using computer vision which is a part of azure cognitive services, we can do image processing to label content with objects, moderate content, identify objects in image, extract text, generate details descriptions of the image, orientations, people movements and so on.<br>

The word “cognitive” means mental action or process of acquiring in gaining knowledge and understanding through thoughts, experience, and the senses. (Copied from Wikipedia). Thinking, Visualizing, Knowing, Learning, Judging, and discovering, deciding etc. are the actions of cognitive.<br>

Visual studio (I am using Visual studio 2019, however, it will be same for other versions as well)
.NET 5.0 (ASP.NET core 5.0)<br>
Note: I will be doing this tutorial with asp.net core 5.0<br>

Including AI feature in any application has become quite simple using azure cognitive services without having much knowledge of AI or machine learning. In this article, I have explained about image analysis with it feature and computer vision service. Furthermore, I have portrayed how to create a cognitive service, computer vision from the azure portal. Additionally, I have implemented the service in asp.net core 5.0 using visual studio with examples. Finally, I have done some image analysis and explored the analysis results.
